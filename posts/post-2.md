# Working with Markdown in Next.js

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. In this post, we'll learn how to use markdown files as a data source in a Next.js blog.

npm install gray-matter remark remark-html

- **remark**: Processes markdown content
- **remark-html**: Converts markdown to HTML
